# Verified to Work in Release
This example repository shows how to use a [CloudFormation template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-sample-templates.html) with Release. The CloudFormation template creates a simple [DynamoDB table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html) and then tears it down when the environment is deleted.

> :warning: **WARNING** This template creates an Amazon DynamoDB table. You will be billed for the AWS resources used if you create a stack from this template.
